## How it Works
* The user first signs up for an account that allows them access to their own Profile. The profile will allow the user to add a home.

* Once logged in the user can begin to add homes.
    * Then from the profile page the user can click on their home and begin to add services, products, and any maintenence their home has had.

* The user can then log off the website and log back in whenever they would like to see any services their home has had or add more services.

* That is it a simple, fast and effective way to keep track of all your homes updates and past purchases.
