added react-bootstrap
    npm i react-boostrap bootstrap
    src/index.js: import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

css idea
name each after their respective page/component
    page: keep in css folder inside pages folder
    component: keep in each component folder

AddFile.js
buttons don't have to be buttons
may have to revisit switch vs links

All Forms
? possible for array and loop?
double check naming conventions
? date input type?
import mutations from @apollo-react/hooks

AboutHouse.js
? need login mutation and auth?
? rename value to homeValue?
? split up address?
I think the ternary operator did the trick, may need to tweak true/false

Products.js
? form group for "room"
    have array for options?
    allow adding rooms to other?

Remodels.js
?   //room as type=select
    room: '',
    //company
    split out as sub inputs for companies worked with?
    make these hide/show?
    //products
    how to layout input array?
add BusinessCard component
? add products array?

Services.js
add BusinessCard component
? add products array?

House.js
? add Nav/Content components to imitate react-portfolio?
button doesn't have to be a button

All View components
reference queries file (useQuery())

ViewAboutHouse.js

ViewProducts.js
add array of objects to display all products

ViewRemodels.js
add array of objects to display all remodels

ViewServices.js
add array of objects to display all services

mutations.js
Auth.js is being built out, may have to revisit
? _id vs homeId? figure out connections
? also, _id vs all other instances of _id? may have to differentiate
? type Home {
    homeServices: [Services]
    homeRemodels: [Remodel]
    homeProducts: [Product]
    homeMaintenances: [Maintenance]
} should I build out a breakdown for each bit of info gathered,
    or will that be gathered in the other forms?

build out BusinessCard component
need BusinessCard input

typeDefs ?
type Query {
        me: User
        home(_id: ID!): Home
        services(_id: ID!): Home
        remodels(_id: ID!): Home
        products(_id: ID!): Home
        maintenance(_id: ID!): Home
    }
